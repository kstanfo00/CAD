### Reflection
This assignment was a kind of hard, because we had to fillet a lot of sides of the swing arm. We also had to figure out how much to extrude the arm, and how to change the variables between swing arm versions.

#### Reflection
This assignment was pretty fun to make, because both me and my partner had to work together to create a pull copter at the same time. Something I learned, was how to do a section view. This makes it so you can see the inside of a object.

### Reflection
This assignment was the hardest cad assignment I've done, because we could only work in one studio. This also made it hard to mate connect each part, as well as copy and transform each part. We also had to change the variables to create a new version of the parts.
