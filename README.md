### Reflection
This assignment was a kind of hard, because we had to fillet a lot of sides of the swing arm. We also had to figure out how much to extrude the arm, and how to change the variables between swing arm versions. 



## Pull_Copter

### Description & Pictures
For this assignment, we were tasked to create different parts of a propeller to make a pull copter

### Reflection
This assignment was pretty fun to make, because both me and my partner had to work together to create a pull copter at the same time. Something I learned, was how to do a section view. This makes it so you can see the inside of a object.




## Multipart

### Description & Pictures
For this assignment, we were tasked to make multiple parts in one studio, and assemble them together.
